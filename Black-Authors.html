                <h2><i>The Weight of  Blood</i> by Tiffany D. Jackson</h2>
                
                <h3 class="rating">4.5 Stars</h3>
                <p>
                    Wow, what a read. I went into this book only knowing it heavily focused on racism.. At some point, I was told it was a Carrie retelling, but I completely forgot that until <span class="spoiler"> Maddy's telekinesis came into play</span>. It was interesting that Jackson chose to write many of the chapters from the points of views of those closest to Maddie's tormentors and not from her own perspective, as the only thing it revealed about the perspectives of the racist and intolerant is that they are vapid and self-absorbed. Accurate, but I also would have liked to listen to more of Madison's point of view - although it was painful and angering. At least until <span class="spoiler"> she started to use her powers, and then it was on! I wish she would have paid everyone more revenge before the big massacre at the end, but I'm also not too mad at it. I understand too why there was no distinction between the black and white students in the massacre. Nobody at all wanted to befriend Maddy, be cordial, or even stick up for her once in their entire school career since third grade. Kenny's sister cast her aside without a second thought because she inaccurately attributed Maddy's claiming to be white all these years to it being her own decision, and never really listened to Kenny's attempts to explain (which honestly were not the best explanations...). Kenny was the only one who took the time to get to know her at all, while everyone else either bullied her, laughed, or stood by and did nothing.
                    Don't get me started on Kendrick, either. A large part of his fascination with her was that she was a virgin of friends, boyfriends, and sex - he even said as much. Also just the fact that he was tired of his 'friends' and living under his father's roof, and Maddy provided a convenient escape from everything. He did seem to love her for some actual real reasons as well, but overall it seemed misguided and fake to an extent. Though to be honest I'm sure they got away together and were able to live a loving life with each other away from the town of Springville. </span>

                <h2><i>Young King: Take Your Stand</i> by Dexter A. Powell Jr.</h2>
                
                <h3 class="rating">5 Stars</h3>
                <p>
                    A powerful true story of how one bad decision and several subsequent decisions led a 12-year-old Dexter A. Powell Jr. to a felony charge andjail sentence, and how he managed to change the sentence passed down to him by society and the judge who sentenced him. n inspiring read for all of us, and especially young black men.
                    <br>
                    This was a short but powerful read. Though addressed to black men, I got a lot out of this about how to move through the world with intention and calm/peace. About the potential of all of us (black folk), and to not let temporary discomfort drive us to make decisions that could negatively impact our future. I would encourage all black men and women of all ages to read this book - it can help you start to make necessary positive changes in your life to become the King or Queen you are destined to be.
                    <br>
                    Thank you, Dexter, for writing this for us.

                <h2><i>The Black Kids</i> by Christina Hammonds Reed</h2>
                
                <h3 class="rating"></span></h3>
                <p>
                    This is the story of a black teenager who has grown up not understanding her sister's activism, grown up not really understanding herself, has grown up with all white friends who don't understand her, and who is trying to figure all of these things out in the midst of the protests and uprisings after Rodney King's murder at the hands of police. As Ashley tries to navigate parents who don't understand her or her sister, her sister's depression that none of the family want to acknowledge, the increasingly overt racism and racial insensitivity displayed by her 'friends', and her sister's staunch activism clashing with Ashley's desire for her sister to simply stay safe, she also has to battle her response to the protests, uprisings, and riots that have grown out of the Rodney King's murder. Not to mention, she's still in high school and feels the closest to the live-in nanny her family has had since she was not much older than a toddler. <br>
                    A powerful, essential, and frustrating read that explores tough topics. I applaud Christina Hammonds Reed for artfully exploring the theme of depression and mental illness in general being largely an uncomfortable and unapproachable subject in many black families.

                <h2><i>Every Body Looking</i> by Candice Iloh</h2>
               
                <h3 class="rating">4 Stars</h3>
                <p>
                    A story in verse about a young woman, Adah, who has grown up through her parent's divorce, growing up with a father who is much more concentrated on teching hi daughter to be religious and propr than he is with listening to her and listening to who she is and who she wants to be. A story of discovery that leaves readers with a  sense of hope. <br>
                    This was a really honest take on how stifling growing up with parents who favor god and faith over anything else. Adah's father was so focused on her outwardly being a good Christian girl, that he never once stopped to ask or even think about what Adah wanted to do, what she wanted to major in, what she wanted to make of her life. She doesn't ever even feel close enough to him to <span class="spoiler"> tell him that she was sexually assaulted at the age of 6. She knows enough about how he thinks of women in this ultra-religious view to avoid telling him anything that would make him view her as lesser. ?Just imagine having to carry that burden around, never telling anyone and carrying the weight of thinking you're less than for an act someone did to you.</span> <br>
                    I enjoyed this read, though painful, and was happy to see <span class="spoiler">Adah finally start to make decisions for herself and by herself, even though the book ends on a cliffhanger.</span>

                <h3><span class="rating">5 Stars</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Wow!! I could not get enough of this book. I listened to the audiobook and was hanging off of every. single. word the narrator spoke. I immediately felt for the main character and was rooting for her the entire time - through all of the bullying, her mother's antics, and even the recounting of past events where Mary has clearly been wronged. I believed Mary every step of the way and was so frustrated with <span class="spoiler"> all of the people who didn't believe her just because her mother said she was guilty. I know her mother was mentally ill and not fully in control of her actions at all times, but the fact that she kept visiting Mary and expecting her to be her perfect obedient daughter, getting irrationally upset when she didn't behave as expected, just disgusted me to my core. </span>
                    I enjoyed everything about the experience of reading this book, but that twist at the end?? That was pure gold. I could not believe that <span class="spoiler">Mary had been guilty this whole time!!!! I still think the sentence was excessive and just wrong - at that age they should have focused more on really figuring out what led her to those actions (definitely abuse at the hands of her mother played a huge part) and focusing on rehabilitating her, not just throwing her into juvie the first chance they got. But she was a young black girl, not a young white girl, so her chances of getting any real help were always going to be lower than low.</span>

                <h3><span class="rating">5 Stars</span></h3>
                <p>
                    I loved this novel in verse. Dean Atta painted a beautiful portrait of life in England as a mixed, gay young man growing up in England. I laughed, nearly teared up, was angry, and felt inspired while reading this book. I have never liked or understood poetry much, but after reading several novels in verse by black/mixed authors such as this one, I think I simply hadn't found the right poetry writers that spoke to me.

                <p>
                    The main character of this book annoyed me to no end, not realizing bits of information that had been handed to her on a silver platter, shying away from doing things that could get her answers faster for what were, to me, incredibly silly reasons, and just making stupid choice throughout the book. I feel she was written so as to be purposely dense to further along the plot of the book, making for an altogether unpleasant reading experience. At one point a character said something along the lines of 'he told me he was a lawyer', to the main character, and two lines later the MC asked him 'so how did you know he was a lawyer?' It was an incredibly annoying read that I may not have been able to finish had I not listened to the audioobook. The portion of the story about binging the family ice cream shop back to life was interesting but not enough to redeem the story much.

                <h3><span class="rating">3.75 Stars</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Within the first few chapters of this book, the disturbing content of <span class="spoiler"> a child/adult relationship was presented. It comes out later that the main character Shori, is actually 53 years old, but due to the development of her species (the Ina), she appears to be only 10 or 11. When an Ina bites a human and draws blood from them enough, and assuming they both like each other, they become bound to each other in an Aina/Symbiant relationship. This is what occurs in the beginning of the book without explanation and it was initially uncomfortable. If I didn't know the author to be the great Octavia Butler, I would probably have stopped reading. But I thought 'Butler likely has a point to this'.</span>  One of the things that I got from this relationship and the book as a whole is the fact that your size and looks do not determine your strength and power in the world, though others may judge you on these things alone. 
                    I loved reading about a matriarchal species where the youngest females are the most powerful and the most dangerous. 
                    I also just loved reading about a black vampire-based character! In the book, it is very clear that the Ina are not actually Vampires, but have inspired the human concept of vampires. 
                    I thought the book was going so well, and I was so interested in how everything was going to resolve with the <span class="spoiler"> sentencing of the Silk family and Katharine Dalman for their acts of murder</span>. I was listening to the audiobook and imagine my shock when the book suddenly ended right after <span class="spoiler"> Shori woke up after fending off Katharine's trying to murder her and her Symbiants. I was already shocked when the book ended after the attack and the rest was the afterword.</span> Even knowing that Butler was setting this up to be a series, I thought the ending was way too abrupt! Overall a good read (listen), however.

                <p>
                    I thought this book was okay. I was really expecting more elements of murder and plotting, and that's not what I got. It was more a character study of two sisters from the perspective of one sister, the one tasked with cleaning up after her younger sister's mistakes and impulsive actions. There was just not enough action in this book for me, and while the stories of the two sisters in the past and in the present were interesting enough for me to finish the book, I just didn't find it easy to maintain interest in this one. Because it was short it was an easy and relatively fast read, but I was disappointed in it.
