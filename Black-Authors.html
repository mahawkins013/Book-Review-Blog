                <h1><i>Young King: Take Your Stand</i> by Dexter A. Powell Jr.
                <br><br>
                <span class="rating">5 Stars</span></h1>
                <p>
                    A powerful true story of how one bad decision and several subsequent decisions led a 12-year-old Dexter A. Powell Jr. to a felony charge andjail sentence, and how he managed to change the sentence passed down to him by society and the judge who sentenced him. n inspiring read for all of us, and especially young black men.
                    <br>
                    This was a short but powerful read. Though addressed to black men, I got a lot out of this about how to move through the world with intention and calm/peace. About the potential of all of us (black folk), and to not let temporary discomfort drive us to make decisions that could negatively impact our future. I would encourage all black men and women of all ages to read this book - it can help you start to make necessary positive changes in your life to become the King or Queen you are destined to be.
                    <br>
                    Thank you, Dexter, for writing this for us.
                </p>

                <h1><i>The Black Kids</i> by Christina Hammonds Reed
                <br><br>
                <span class="rating"></span></h1>
                <p>
                    This is the story of a black teenager who has grown up not understanding her sister's activism, grown up not really understanding herself, has grown up with all white friends who don't understand her, and who is trying to figure all of these things out in the midst of the protests and uprisings after Rodney King's murder at the hands of police. As Ashley tries to navigate parents who don't understand her or her sister, her sister's depression that none of the family want to acknowledge, the increasingly overt racism and racial insensitivity displayed by her 'friends', and her sister's staunch activism clashing with Ashley's desire for her sister to simply stay safe, she also has to battle her response to the protests, uprisings, and riots that have grown out of the Rodney King's murder. Not to mention, she's still in high school and feels the closest to the live-in nanny her family has had since she was not much older than a toddler. <br>
                    A powerful, essential, and frustrating read that explores tough topics. I applaud Christina Hammonds Reed for artfully exploring the theme of depression and mental illness in general being largely an uncomfortable and unapproachable subject in many black families.

                <h1><i>Every Body Looking</i> by Candice Iloh
                <br><br>
                <span class="rating">4 Stars</span></h1>
                <p>
                    A story in verse about a young woman, Adah, who has grown up through her parent's divorce, growing up with a father who is much more concentrated on teching hi daughter to be religious and propr than he is with listening to her and listening to who she is and who she wants to be. A story of discovery that leaves readers with a  sense of hope. <br>
                    This was a really honest take on how stifling growing up with parents who favor god and faith over anything else. Adah's father was so focused on her outwardly being a good Christian girl, that he never once stopped to ask or even think about what Adah wanted to do, what she wanted to major in, what she wanted to make of her life. She doesn't ever even feel close enough to him to <span class="spoiler"> tell him that she was sexually assaulted at the age of 6. She knows enough about how he thinks of women in this ultra-religious view to avoid telling him anything that would make him view her as lesser. ?Just imagine having to carry that burden around, never telling anyone and carrying the weight of thinking you're less than for an act someone did to you.</span> <br>
                    I enjoyed this read, though painful, and was happy to see <span class="spoiler">Adah finally start to make decisions for herself and by herself, even though the book ends on a cliffhanger.</span>

                <h1><i>Allegedly</i> by Tiffany D. Jackson

                    Wow!! I could not get enough of this book. I listened to the audiobook and was hanging off of every. single. word the narrator spoke. I immediately felt for the main character and was rooting for her the entire time - through all of the bullying, her mother's antics, and even the recounting of past events where Mary has clearly been wronged. I believed Mary every step of the way and was so frustrated with <span class="spoiler"> all of the people who didn't believe her just because her mother said she was guilty. I know her mother was mentally ill and not fully in control of her actions at all times, but the fact that she kept visiting Mary and expecting her to be her perfect obedient daughter, getting irrationally upset when she didn't behave as expected, just disgusted me to my core. </span>
                    I enjoyed everything about the experience of reading this book, but that twist at the end?? That was pure gold. I could not believe that <span class="spoiler">Mary had been guilty this whole time!!!! I still think the sentence was excessive and just wrong - at that age they should have focused more on really figuring out what led her to those actions (definitely abuse at the hands of her mother played a huge part) and focusing on rehabilitating her, not just throwing her into juvie the first chance they got. But she was a young black girl, not a young white girl, so her chances of getting any real help were always going to be lower than low.</span>
