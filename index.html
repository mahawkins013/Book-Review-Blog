        <h2 id="subtitle">Book Reviews from a Black Perspective</h2>
        <div class="starting-text" id="starting-text">
        <p>I've noticed in the past year, since joining several book club Discord servers and Goodreads groups, that outside of groups specifically aimed at either black membership or reading books by black authors, there is an overwhelmingly non-black presence in these clubs and groups. I am here to provide a black reader's perspective on some of the popular and some of the hardly heard of books, because I have seen a lack of and need for it. One book that inspired me to think this way was "No Exit" by Taylor Adams.</p>
        <br><figure id="no-exit-cover"><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1541624527l/39938177.jpg"><figcaption>Hovering between 1-2 Stars</figcaption></figure>
        <p>I am tempted to rate this book 1 Star, but I currently have the rating on Goodreads as 2 as a reminder of the potential this book had and that the author so ridiculously chose to throw away. Let me explain:</p>
        <blockquote>Please be aware, mild spoilers await you below</blockquote>
        <p>This book started off interesting, even as it started off on a quickly freezing mountain-side road in a vehicle driven by the main character, Darby. A seemingly banal start, as far as books go, but Darby proved to be a gripping character. The suspense was on when we got to the rest stop where Darby and 4 other people had to wait out the snowstorm and bet on snowplows in order to leave. The backstory of all the characters ensued in well-crafted snippets that flowed into the storyline and served as explanations for current, past, or future actions or ways of thinking. It was in one of these snippets that Adams' irreparable blunder occured. He chose to haphazardly insert the N word into book - spelled out fully - only as a tool for painting a character as a racist bigot. The word served its purpose in that line alone, and then the story quite abruptly moved right along. It was so jarring I had to stop reading for a while. I decided to finish the book, but only out of a duty to report on my findings, and any other potential findings.</p>
        <p>When I looked at a couple dozen reviews of this book on Goodreads, I didn't see any mention of this word, or anyone's objection to Taylor, a white male author, using it so tactlessly in his book for shock value. I realized that nobody from my book groups had warned me of this either, and notably, none of the people that had raved about the book and suggested it were black or of color.</p>

            <h1><i>Slade House</i> by David Mitchell</h1>
            <p>What an absolute spiral of a story! Calling up memories of Junji Ito's Uzumaki).
                I got it by the second or third part of the book, but was confused as to how these seemingly random short stories fit together at first. The book was a really quick listen (listened to the audiobook) and I enjoyed it, though I completely lost focus when <span class="spoiler">the backstory was being explained by who turned out to be a fake Fred Pink and was actually Jonah Grayer. As he explained everything that went into the creation of his and his sister's lacunah, I just could not get my mind to focus or be interested in the words. I caught the important bits that were necessary to understanding the book, but most of that section was lost on me. This contributed highly to my rating of 3 out of 5, as a significant portion of the book was uninteresting to me.</span>
                I also thought the stories could have been melded together a bit better as far as the sharp stops at the end of each one, but that's just me. Overall a good read, but not great for me.</p>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset class="reviews" id="hench">
            <h1><i>Hench</i> by Natalie Zina Walschots</h1>
            <p>This was a weirdly slow read even though I really enjoyed the main character and the premise of the book - Henches that essentially act as the Villain equivalent of sidekicks for Superheroes, though largely doing behind-the-scenes work. I loved the sense of justice that fueled the story and the main character's (Anna's) journey, <span class="spoiler">being caught in the cross-fire of the biggest Superhero of the time, Supercollider, and in one careless move, having her leg broken in a way that would never heal completely to its original state.</span>

            I did think the story dragged on at times which caused me to read and finish several other books in between reading this one. The romantic interest Anna had in <span class="spoiler">Leviathan started to creep up on you and it seemed to come out of nowhere. I really expected it to go somewhere by the time I got to the end of the book, and especially once Leviathan was rescued from Supercollider's grasp after he had been captured and his death faked. But it went absolutely nowhere, and while Leviathan was captured and one of his long-time arch nemeses, Quantum Entanglement (formerly Supercollider's sidekick) is realizing that Anna loves Leviathan, Anna is going on about how she thinks there may be a budding romance with Quantum in her mind. This is not an entirely unrealistic scenario, it just felt a little lackluster. And to top it all off, the 'relationship' with Quantum went nowhere as well, as she fled as soon as she realized that Leviathan was still alive.</span>

            So the book was good and had a glorious ending battle scene full of justice, the book had some elements that don't seem to have been fully thought out. I am interested in reading the sequel to this book though, should one ever come about.</p>
