        <h2 id="subtitle">Book Reviews from a Black Perspective</h2></div>
        <div class="starting-text" id="starting-text">
        <p>I've noticed in the past year, since joining several book club Discord servers and Goodreads groups, that outside of groups specifically aimed at either black membership or reading books by black authors, there is an overwhelmingly non-black presence in these clubs and groups. I am here to provide a black reader's perspective on some of the popular and some of the hardly heard of books, because I have seen a lack of and need for it. One book that inspired me to think this way was "No Exit" by Taylor Adams.</p>
        <br><figure id="no-exit-cover"><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1541624527l/39938177.jpg"><figcaption>Hovering between 1-2 Stars</figcaption></figure>
        <p>I am tempted to rate this book 1 Star, but I currently have the rating on Goodreads as 2 as a reminder of the potential this book had and that the author so ridiculously chose to throw away. Let me explain:</p>
        <blockquote>Please be aware, mild spoilers await you below</blockquote>
        <p>This book started off interesting, even as it started off on a quickly freezing mountain-side road in a vehicle driven by the main character, Darby. A seemingly banal start, as far as books go, but Darby proved to be a gripping character. The suspense was on when we got to the rest stop where Darby and 4 other people had to wait out the snowstorm and bet on snowplows in order to leave. The backstory of all the characters ensued in well-crafted snippets that flowed into the storyline and served as explanations for current, past, or future actions or ways of thinking. It was in one of these snippets that Adams' irreparable blunder occured. He chose to haphazardly insert the N word into book - spelled out fully - only as a tool for painting a character as a racist bigot. The word served its purpose in that line alone, and then the story quite abruptly moved right along. It was so jarring I had to stop reading for a while. I decided to finish the book, but only out of a duty to report on my findings, and any other potential findings.</p>
        <p>When I looked at a couple dozen reviews of this book on Goodreads, I didn't see any mention of this word, or anyone's objection to Taylor, a white male author, using it so tactlessly in his book for shock value. I realized that nobody from my book groups had warned me of this either, and notably, none of the people that had raved about the book and suggested it were black or of color.</p>

                <h2><i>Lakewood</i> by Akwaeke Emezi</h2>
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="rating">4 Stars</h3>
                <p>
                    Wow! What a book! This book started off emotional and on the slower side, but it quickly picked up a few chapters in and just picked up more and more speed until I felt as though I was furiously rolling down a hill - disoriented and barely able to keep up with what was going on. I enjoyed the storyline and the tie-ins to the reality of the reckless and careless medical testing that's been sadistically carried out on black people throughout the years. I thought that the plot was really gearing up for a large exposure of the company doing the testing in the book, some justice that wouldn't have made up for the events that took place, but would have at least served some well-deserved revenge. But the ending was a let-down for me. It seemed that <span class="spoiler"> everyone involved in carrying out the shady, sadistic, horrid medical testing on the mostly black test subjects got away with everything they had been doing for decades. It's great that they let Lena get away, but the damage was done to her and to her mom and grandma. I guess I can see the point of the ending - that these things rooted in systemic racism and the belief that black people are lesser than and therefore worthy of being subjected to any old studies because who cares are just so so difficult to tear down. It takes so much to tear down systems built up and maintained over hundreds of years. One or two people alone aren't going to be able to change them. It's realistic but still really got me down when I finished the book.</span>

                    Wow, what a read. I went into this book only knowing it heavily focused on racism.. At some point, I was told it was a Carrie retelling, but I completely forgot that until <span class="spoiler"> Maddy's telekinesis came into play</span>. It was interesting that Jackson chose to write many of the chapters from the points of views of those closest to Maddie's tormentors and not from her own perspective, as the only thing it revealed about the perspectives of the racist and intolerant is that they are vapid and self-absorbed. Accurate, but I also would have liked to listen to more of Madison's point of view - although it was painful and angering. At least until <span class="spoiler"> she started to use her powers, and then it was on! I wish she would have paid everyone more revenge before the big massacre at the end, but I'm also not too mad at it. I understand too why there was no distinction between the black and white students in the massacre. Nobody at all wanted to befriend Maddie, be cordial, or even stick up for her once in their entire school career since third grade. Kenny's sister cast her aside without a second thought because she inaccurately attributed Maddy's claiming to be white all these years to it being her own decision, and never really listened to Kenny's attempts to explain (which honestly were not the best explanations...). Kenny was the only one who took the time to get to know her at all, while everyone else either bullied her, laughed, or stood by and did nothing.
                    Don't get me started on Kendrick, either. A large part of his fascination with her was that she was a virgin of friends, boyfriends, and sex - he even said as much. Also just the fact that he was tired of his 'friends' and living under his father's roof, and Maddy provided a convenient escape from everything. He did seem to love her for some actual real reasons as well, but overall it seemed misguided and fake to an extent. Though to be honest I'm sure they got away together and were able to live a loving life with each other away from the town of Springville. </span>

                    This was a short but powerful read. Though addressed to black men, I got a lot out of this about how to move through the world with intention and calm/peace. About the potential of all of us (black folk), and to not let temporary discomfort drive us to make decisions that could negatively impact our future. I would encourage all black men and women of all ages to read this book - it can help you start to make necessary positive changes in your life to become the King or Queen you are destined to be.
                    Thank you, Dexter, for writing this for us.

                <h1><i>The Black Kids</i> by Christina Hammonds Reed
                <br><br>
                <h3 class="rating">5 Stars</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the story of a black teenager who has grown up not understanding her sister's activism, grown up not really understanding herself, has grown up with all white friends who don't understand her, and who is trying to figure all of these things out in the midst of the protests and uprisings after Rodney King's murder at the hands of police. As Ashley tries to navigate parents who don't understand her or her sister, her sister's depression that none of the family want to acknowledge, the increasingly overt racism and racial insensitivity displayed by her 'friends', and her sister's staunch activism clashing with Ashley's desire for her sister to simply stay safe, she also has to battle her response to the protests, uprisings, and riots that have grown out of the Rodney King's murder. Not to mention, she's still in high school and feels the closest to the live-in nanny her family has had since she was not much older than a toddler. 
                    A powerful, essential, and frustrating read that explores tough topics. I applaud Christina Hammonds Reed for artfully exploring the theme of depression and mental illness in general being largely an uncomfortable and unapproachable subject in many black families.

                <h3 class="rating">4.5 Stars</h3>
                This was a really honest take on how stifling growing up with parents who favor god and faith over anything else. Adah's father was so focused on her outwardly being a good Christian girl, that he never once stopped to ask or even think about what Adah wanted to do, what she wanted to major in, what she wanted to make of her life. She doesn't ever even feel close enough to him to <span class="spoiler"> tell him that she was sexually assaulted at the age of 6. She knows enough about how he thinks of women in this ultra-religious view to avoid telling him anything that would make him view her as lesser. Just imagine having to carry that burden around, never telling anyone and carrying the weight of thinking you're less than for an act someone did to you.</span>
                I enjoyed this read, though painful, and was happy to see <span class="spoiler">Adah finally start to make decisions for herself and by herself, even though the book ends on a massive cliffhanger.</span>

                <h1><i>Slade House</i> by David Mitchell

                <h3 class="rating">5 Stars</h3>
                Wow!! I could not get enough of this book. I listened to the audiobook and was hanging off of every. single. word the narrator spoke. I immediately felt for the main character and was rooting for her the entire time - through all of the bullying, her mother's antics, and even the recounting of past events where Mary has clearly been wronged. I believed Mary every step of the way and was so frustrated with <span class="spoiler"> all of the people who didn't believe her just because her mother said she was guilty. I know her mother was mentally ill and not fully in control of her actions at all times, but the fact that she kept visiting Mary and expecting her to be her perfect obedient daughter, getting irrationally upset when she didn't behave as expected, just disgusted me to my core. </span>
                I enjoyed everything about the experience of reading this book, but that twist at the end?? That was pure gold. I could not believe that <span class="spoiler">Mary had been guilty this whole time!!!! I still think the sentence was excessive and just wrong - at that age they should have focused more on really figuring out what led her to those actions (definitely abuse at the hands of her mother played a huge part) and focusing on rehabilitating her, not just throwing her into juvie the first chance they got. But she was a young black girl, not a young white girl, so her chances of getting any real help were always going to be lower than low.</span>

                <p>I loved this novel in verse. Dean Atta painted a beautiful portrait of life in England as a mixed, gay young man growing up in England. I laughed, nearly teared up, was angry, and felt inspired while reading this book. I have never liked or understood poetry much, but after reading several novels in verse by black/mixed authors such as this one, I think I simply hadn't found the right poetry writers that spoke to me.
