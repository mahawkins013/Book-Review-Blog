        <h2>Book Reviews from the Black Perspective</h2>
        <div class="starting-text">
        <p>I've noticed in the past year, since joining several book club Discord servers and Goodreads groups, that outside of groups specifically aimed at either black membership or reading books by black authors, there is an overwhelmingly non-black presence in these clubs and groups. I am here to provide a black reader's perspective on some of the popular and some of the hardly heard of books, because I have seen a lack of and need for it. One book that inspired me to think this way was "No Exit" by Taylor Adams.</p>

        <p>I am tempted to rate this book 1 Star, but I currently have the rating on Goodreads as 2 as a reminder of the potential this book had and that the author so ridiculously chose to throw away. Let me explain:</p>
        <blockquote>Please be aware, mild spoilers await you below</blockquote>
        <p>This book started off interesting, even as it started off on a quickly freezing mountain-side road in a vehicle driven by the main character, Darby. A seemingly banal start, as far as books go, but Darby proved to be a gripping character. The suspense was on when we got to the rest stop where Darby and 4 other people had to wait out the snowstorm and bet on snowplows in order to leave. The backstory of all the characters ensued in well-crafted snippets that flowed into the storyline and served as explanations for current, past, or future actions or ways of thinking. It was in one of these snippets that Adams' irreparable blunder occured. He chose to haphazardly insert the N word into book - spelled out fully - only as a tool for painting a character as a racist bigot. The word served its purpose in that line alone, and then the story quite abruptly moved right along. It was so jarring I had to stop reading for a while. I decided to finish the book, but only out of a duty to report on my findings, and any other potential findings.</p>
        <p>When I looked at a couple dozen reviews of this book on Goodreads, I didn't see any mention of this word, or anyone's objection to Taylor, a white male author, using it so tactlessly in his book for shock value. I realized that nobody from my book groups had warned me of this either, and notably, none of the people that had raved about the book and suggested it were black or of color.</p>
