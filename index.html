        <div class="starting-text" id="starting-text">
        <p>I've noticed in the past year, since joining several book club Discord servers and Goodreads groups, that outside of groups specifically aimed at either black membership or reading books by black authors, there is an overwhelmingly non-black presence in these clubs and groups. I am here to provide a black reader's perspective on some of the popular and some of the hardly heard of books, because I have seen a lack of and need for it. One book that inspired me to think this way was "No Exit" by Taylor Adams.</p>
        <br><figure id="no-exit-cover"><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1541624527l/39938177.jpg"><figcaption>Hovering between 1-2 Stars</figcaption></figure>
        <p>I am tempted to rate this book 1 Star, but I currently have the rating on Goodreads as 2 as a reminder of the potential this book had and that the author so ridiculously chose to throw away. Let me explain:</p>
        <blockquote>Please be aware, mild spoilers await you below</blockquote>
        <p>This book started off interesting, even as it started off on a quickly freezing mountain-side road in a vehicle driven by the main character, Darby. A seemingly banal start, as far as books go, but Darby proved to be a gripping character. The suspense was on when we got to the rest stop where Darby and 4 other people had to wait out the snowstorm and bet on snowplows in order to leave. The backstory of all the characters ensued in well-crafted snippets that flowed into the storyline and served as explanations for current, past, or future actions or ways of thinking. It was in one of these snippets that Adams' irreparable blunder occured. He chose to haphazardly insert the N word into book - spelled out fully - only as a tool for painting a character as a racist bigot. The word served its purpose in that line alone, and then the story quite abruptly moved right along. It was so jarring I had to stop reading for a while. I decided to finish the book, but only out of a duty to report on my findings, and any other potential findings.</p>
        <p>When I looked at a couple dozen reviews of this book on Goodreads, I didn't see any mention of this word, or anyone's objection to Taylor, a white male author, using it so tactlessly in his book for shock value. I realized that nobody from my book groups had warned me of this either, and notably, none of the people that had raved about the book and suggested it were black or of color.</p>

                <h1><i>Bitter</i> by Akwaeke Emezi
                <br><br>
                <span class="rating">4.25 Stars</span></h1>

                    I enjoyed this book, and I am glad I chose to listen to the audiobook for this one, as the cast was just as amazing as the cast that read Pet. I will say though, that I did not find the main character to be all that likeable, mostly because the decisions she made and a lot of the feelings she felt throughout the book were just foreign to me. <span>She felt so much guilt after she called Vengeance through and he declared that he and the other Angels/Hunters were there to seek out the monsters of her town and execute them, I would have been all for that, but even if I hadn't been so sure about it, it's not like I would have thought it was my fault since there was no way I could have known about the existence of these creatures and their plans for the monsters of the town. Bitter just took everything to heart and was so so empathetic in a way that I simply could not relate to. She went to such lengths to stop the killings and, sure, in the end it only took a few of the targeted deaths to bring peace and equal wealth distribution to Lucille, but I felt that at the very least, the greatest monster of Lucille needed to be killed, and I don't know why she couldn't see that.</span> 
                    I enjoyed the themes of this book, and it was nice to see so many young people coming together to fight for a better present and future for themselves, though frustrating to see that the elderly in the book had been fighting the same fight when they were the same ages. It echoes reality in America for poor and working-class people of color perfectly.

                <span class="rating">5 Stars</span></h1>
                <p>
                    I absolutely loved this read, even though it threatened to make me cry even from the first couple of chapters, and I hate to cry while I read or watch media. I felt every bit of this, and though a lot of the scenarios depicted in this book are not ones I have ever encountered, Coles writes in such a way that you truly feel the weight of the words, the actions of the main character and other characters, and the pain and utter despair brought about by <span class="spoiler">Tyler's murder</span>. I think everyone should read this book. It doesn't go incredibly in-depth on the subjects, but it is a good introduction for anyone who doesn't understand the weight the media has in pushing racism, bigotry, and prejudice towards victims of police brutality and murder. The way media depicts victims as thugs, unworthy of having ever lived because they sold drugs, were part of a gang, or commmitted some petty or serious crime. Media will make those with weak mindsets believe that it's a good thing these people were murdered when they were, so that now they're off the streets and things are safer for everyone. It's absolute bullshit, and this book does a good job of exposing that while also focusing on the very real effects of not only the loss of a brother and son, but the effect of having to hear daily how your brother, son, (and outside of this book, husband, cousin, nephew, etc.) sold drugs and therefore was scum of the earth and deserved to be murdered when he wasn't doing anything wrong. 
                    Powerful book.

                    This book was an okay read. It was certainly a quick and relatively easy read (it was confusing keeping the characters in order for longer than I was comfortable with), but that was largely to do with the content being easy to consume, and not with it being very interesting to consume. Granted, while this book was a standard-issue thriller with all the right elements, it did have some nuances in the details of the story. It was a finals girls story spanning two incidents, and though I've read less than a handful of final girls books, this one still felt too familiar for me to like it more than just casually. I did think that the 'who did it' moments and bits of discovery in the book were interesting, just not interesting enough to rate this book above a 3. It was just okay in my book.

                <h1><i>The After Party</i> by A. C. Arthur 
                <br><br>
                <span class="rating">5 Stars</span></h1>
                <p>Wow! Okay, if you are on the fence about picking this book up, or you have it in your TBR but aren't planning to read it soon - read it now!! The story and stories of Venus, Jackie, and Draya sucked me in from page one and still hasn't let go! I absolutely loved that this book was a thriller, but it was entirely character-driven (and still had an amazing plot) and included themes of romance, sex, friendship, family, coming out to an unaccepting crowd, and black professionalism. I love that this book started out in a diverse office setting with black leadership and black clients throughout. That's something I don't see much in literature.
                I enjoyed following the story as the narration switched between Jackie, Draya, and Venus's points of view, and I especially enjoyed seeing all three women grow by the end of the book in ways that felt natural and right for them.
                This book was a joy to read, and a joy to think about who the murderer was! The only thing I was disappointed by was that almost no time was spent on the discovery of who did it, and the aftermath of that discovery. This does make sense however, since the book was largely character-driven, and it didn't dock any points off of the book for me.

                <h1><i>A Good Girl's Guide to Murder</i> by Holly Jackson
                <br><br>
                <span class="rating">4.5 Stars</span></h1>
                <p>This was a pretty great book! I actually listened to the audiobook and loved that it had a full cast (well, the main character's voice actor actually voiced several characters, which I was confused about because one of those characters showed up in the book enough to have had his own voice actor I would have thought -- nonetheless there were plenty of voices and it was easy enough to tell people apart when it was one of the people the MC was voicing). I enjoyed every second of it! Love that Pippa took it upon herself to <span class="spoiler"> solve a murder! She really put her all into it and my only frustration was her not seeing through the whole 'you'll get your dog back when I see you destroy all the evidence you have on the case' bit. Granted, her dog allegedly just fell into the river and drowned after it had been released, but I don't really buy that story. I'm glad Ravi saw through her attempts to get him to let the case go and figured out why she was scared to continue. And I'm so glad Pippa actually ended up keeping copies of everything she had gathered on the case!</span>
                I enjoyed seeing the relationships in the book flourish and change, and thought this was done well in such a plot-driven book. I think the book ended well and wasn't as rushed as some other thrillers tend to be. 
                I will say though, in reading a review of this book earlier today without context, I couldn't match what I was reading about it to this book until I scrolled up to see what I was reading a review of. Strange that I already forgot so much about the book in the 7 days since I've finished it, so I will be docking it half a star for lack of memorability, though I thought it was pretty memorable at the time of reading it. Curious. </p>

                <span class="rating">3 Stars</span></h1>
                <p>What an absolute spiral of a story! Calling up memories of Junji Ito's Uzumaki).
                I got it by the second or third part of the book, but was confused as to how these seemingly random short stories fit together at first. The book was a really quick listen (listened to the audiobook) and I enjoyed it, though I completely lost focus when <span class="spoiler">the backstory was being explained by who turned out to be a fake Fred Pink and was actually Jonah Grayer. As he explained everything that went into the creation of his and his sister's lacunah, I just could not get my mind to focus or be interested in the words. I caught the important bits that were necessary to understanding the book, but most of that section was lost on me. This contributed highly to my rating of 3 out of 5, as a significant portion of the book was uninteresting to me.</span>
                I also thought the stories could have been melded together a bit better as far as the sharp stops at the end of each one, but that's just me. Overall a good read, but not great for me.</p>

                <h1><i>Hench</i> by Natalie Zina Walschots<br><br>
                <span class="rating">4 Stars</span></h1>
            
                <p>This was a weirdly slow read even though I really enjoyed the main character and the premise of the book - Henches that essentially act as the Villain equivalent of sidekicks for Superheroes, though largely doing behind-the-scenes work. I loved the sense of justice that fueled the story and the main character's (Anna's) journey, <span class="spoiler">being caught in the cross-fire of the biggest Superhero of the time, Supercollider, and in one careless move, having her leg broken in a way that would never heal completely to its original state.</span>

                I did think the story dragged on at times which caused me to read and finish several other books in between reading this one. The romantic interest Anna had in <span class="spoiler">Leviathan started to creep up on you and it seemed to come out of nowhere. I really expected it to go somewhere by the time I got to the end of the book, and especially once Leviathan was rescued from Supercollider's grasp after he had been captured and his death faked. But it went absolutely nowhere, and while Leviathan was captured and one of his long-time arch nemeses, Quantum Entanglement (formerly Supercollider's sidekick) is realizing that Anna loves Leviathan, Anna is going on about how she thinks there may be a budding romance with Quantum in her mind. This is not an entirely unrealistic scenario, it just felt a little lackluster. And to top it all off, the 'relationship' with Quantum went nowhere as well, as she fled as soon as she realized that Leviathan was still alive.</span>

                So the book was good and had a glorious ending battle scene full of justice, the book had some elements that don't seem to have been fully thought out. I am interested in reading the sequel to this book though, should one ever come about.
